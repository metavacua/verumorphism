(defun check-reflexivity (relation elements interpretation &key (reflexive-threshold 1))
  "Checks if a given binary relation is reflexive for a set of elements.
A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. This function
can use a threshold for graded (non-binary) relations.

Parameters:
  - RELATION: A function representing the logical relation. It should accept
    two elements and an interpretation keyword.
  - ELEMENTS: A list of elements to check for reflexivity.
  - INTERPRETATION: A keyword symbol representing the context or interpretation
    under which the relation is being evaluated.
  - REFLEXIVE-THRESHOLD (Keyword, Optional): A numeric value. For a relation to
    be considered reflexive, its output must be a number greater than or equal
    to this threshold. Defaults to 1.

Returns:
  - T if the relation is reflexive for all elements in the set.
  - NIL if any element is not related to itself according to the threshold."
